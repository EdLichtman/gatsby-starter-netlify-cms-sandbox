### Who am I?
I'm a developer, testing out this gatsby CMS

### What do I need for this?
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- [A github account](https://github.com/)
- [A netlify account](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [The starter template found here](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)

### What did I do to get this running?
1. Downloaded Gatsby-cli
    - Downloaded NPM Latest Version
    - Opened command prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac
    - Ran: npm install -g gatsby-cli 
2. Created a repository on Github
    - Logged in
    - Created new repository
    - Requires minimal understanding of Github and git
3. Downloaded Gatsby Starter Template
    - Navigated to the directory in command prompt
    - Ran the gatsby-cli commands for the starter template
4. Created netlify application. Set up my site for continuous deployment.
    - The Netlify Starter App gives step-by-step directions. I didn't follow those, but the are probably better than the way I did it.
5. Changed the application to my liking in VSCode. 
    - Most of the content lives in the markdown files, so not much to do in the way of styling. Had to change the layout to my liking and remove some stuff. That's where more of the "web development" experience helps.
6. Committed my code to github.
    - Continuous deployment kicked in, and all of my changes show up.
